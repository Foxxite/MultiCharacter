Very simple this is what you **can** do:

- Use the code for reference
- Update or modify it for **PRIVATE USE ONLY**
- Compile it for **PRIVATE USE ONLY**

This is what you **can't** do:
- Redistribute or sell it (source and compiled) (including your own modifications) wihout my permission
- Claim it as your own
- Use parts of the code in your own code
- Make money of it
